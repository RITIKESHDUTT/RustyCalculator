# RustyCalculator

A CLI calculator built with Rust, designed as a practical project to help you understand and apply key Rust language concepts.  
Rather than focusing solely on calculator functionality, this codebase uses the calculator as a vehicle to demonstrate and practice Rust's unique features in a real-world application.

## Why a Calculator?
The calculator was chosen as an approachable example to make Rust concepts easier to grasp. By implementing familiar operations (add, subtract, etc.) with Rustâ€™s advanced features, you can directly see how ownership, error handling, traits, generics, and data structures work in practice.

## Key Rust Concepts Demonstrated

Major Rust features and idioms illustrated here include:

### 1. Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes
- Uses `Rc`, `Weak`, and `RefCell` to enable shared ownership and safe mutability in a tree structure.
- Demonstrates parent-child relationships while managing lifetimes and memory safety.

### 2. Error Handling
- Custom error type `CalculationError` using Rust's `enum` and `impl Display`.
- Implements `Result<T, E>` for all fallible operations, propagating and handling errors gracefully.
- Streamlined error conversions with Rustâ€™s trait-based system.

### 3. Pattern Matching & Control Flow
- Extensive use of `match` statements for input parsing and operation dispatch.

### 4. Traits and Polymorphism
- Calculator logic split into traits (`GeneralOperations`, `LogicOperations`) for abstraction and modularity.

### 5. Structs, Enums, and Method Organization
- Rich use of `struct` and `enum` to model calculator state, node relationships, snapshots, and error variants.

### 6. Builder Functions for Separation of Concerns and Reusability
- Builder-style functions (e.g., `Node::new`, `Node::new_root`) are used to construct and initialize objects, promoting clear separation of concerns and code reusability.

### 7. Type System and Generics
- Strong static typing and generic input parsing (`get_input<T>()`) for flexible, safe conversions.

### 8. Interior Mutability
- Uses `RefCell` for safe mutation of shared nodes, demonstrating Rustâ€™s concurrency and mutation patterns.

### 9. Tree Data Structures
- Calculator history is a tree, supporting undo/redo and hierarchical state recovery.
- Recursive traversal and tree visualization.

### 10. CLI Interaction
- Robust command-line interface using `std::io`, generic parsing, and user-friendly error reporting.

### 11. Snapshot and Recovery Patterns
- Full calculator state can be snapshotted and restored, showing practical use of Rustâ€™s cloning and sharing semantics.
